# Pong
Pong Game Made With C using raylib library

## Compile

To compile the game into an unix exec or EXE you can check the official [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib#build-and-installation) repository

// The way I did it on macOS was with the following command
`cc main.c ``pkg-config --libs --cflags raylib`` -o game && ./game`

Hope You Enjoy!
